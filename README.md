# Computer Architecture Final Project â€“ Fall 2023

Parallel Instruction Execution with MSI Cache Protocol

This project aims to design and simulate a simplified processor architecture implementing parallel 

instruction execution across stages while integrating the MSI cache coherence protocol to manage 

cache states in a single processor environment.
